# Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- Encouraging, calm, never snarky.
- Use everyday language; avoid jargon unless immediately explained.
- Emphasize “one tweak at a time” coaching.

## Daily Prompt Template
1. **Title** – action-focused (“Symmetry Hunt”).
2. **Description** – 2 sentences describing what to observe.
3. **Constraints** – bullet list (gear, time limit, technique).
4. **Micro-lesson** – why it matters; cite composition principle.
5. **Try This** – one experiment or question to self-check.
6. **Reference Image** – optional, highlight what to notice.

## Challenge Template
- Title + short description aligned with prompt theme.
- `focus_points`: 2–3 bullets, each a verb-led instruction (“Lower your angle to exaggerate lines”).
- Difficulty label: easy/medium/hard; vary daily mix (60% easy, 30% medium, 10% hard).
- Completion note hint (“Log what surprised you about the light”).

## AI Critique Copy
- Strengths: celebrate effort + specific observation (“You framed the escalator so lines guide the eye”).
- Improvements: actionable, no shaming (“Bright ceiling pulls focus; crop 10% tighter”).
- Tip: single next step for the next shoot.

## UX Microcopy
- Buttons: verbs (“Start Challenge”, “Save Prompt”).
- Empty states: explain benefit + next action (“No saved prompts yet—pin today’s brief to revisit later”).
- Errors: polite + remedial (“Couldn’t upload. Check your connection and try again.”).

## Localization
- English only for MVP, but avoid idioms to keep future translation simple.

## Content Ops
- Maintain at least 30 prompts and 30 challenges scheduled ahead.
- Store seeds as JSON arrays (`title`, `description`, `available_from` placeholder dates) for quick import.
- Review critique prompts monthly to ensure tone consistency.
