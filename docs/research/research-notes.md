# Research Notes

## Problem Landscape
- Beginners lack structured prompts and lose motivation after generic tutorials.
- Feedback loops are slow or harsh; most online critique communities intimidate newcomers.
- Busy schedules limit practice time; users need short, focused tasks.

## Opportunity
- Combine inspiration, execution, and reflection in one mobile-first loop.
- Lean tech stack (Expo + Supabase + OpenAI) keeps operational costs low.
- Friendly tone differentiates ShutterPath from competitive “pro” tools.

## User Insights
- Interviewees value constraints (“tell me exactly what to try”).
- They want to track streaks but not share publicly until confident.
- One actionable improvement per photo feels digestible.

## Differentiators
- Action-first prompts that tie directly into micro-lessons and challenges.
- AI critique framed as collaborative coach, not scorecard.
- Lightweight progression (streaks, saved prompts) without heavy gamification.

## Monetization Thoughts (Post-MVP)
- Pro tier with extra critiques, advanced challenge packs, and learning paths.
- Brand-sponsored challenges once engagement proves steady.
- Content packs co-created with photographers.

## Success Metrics
- Day 1 → Day 7 retention.
- Average prompts viewed/completed per week.
- Critique usage rate vs. rate-limit hits.
- Conversion to Pro after 7 days (future).

## Competitive Scan (Summary)
- Mood-board apps inspire but do not coach.
- Camera tutorials are content-rich yet lack daily accountability.
- ShutterPath bridges prompt + practice + kindness.
